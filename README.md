Real-Time Collaboration Tool - Internship Project at Codetech IT Solutions

As part of my internship at Codetech IT Solutions, I developed a Real-Time Document Editor, enabling multiple users to collaborate on documents simultaneously. This project involves the creation of a collaborative editing experience where users can make real-time updates, share changes, and see others' edits instantly.


Key Features:

Real-time Document Updates: Multiple users can edit the document simultaneously, with changes instantly reflected across all active sessions.
User Authentication: Secure login for users to track their sessions and collaborate effectively.
Text Formatting: Basic document formatting tools like bold, italic, and underline, to enhance the editing experience.
Sync Across Devices: Users can collaborate from different devices without any delay in updates.
This project demonstrates the practical application of real-time web technologies and collaborative tools, showcasing the ability to build interactive and efficient document editing systems.
